## What

Do you have a lot of starred repositories and often need to look through them, but each time you need to open a new tab to enter `https://github.com` and click on the avatar on the right and click on `your stars`, then you can finally see your stars.

This is too cumbersome and it's a waste of time, fuck it!

Do you have some starred repositories, but their names are so complicated that you can't remember them, causing you to not search for them by name? Fuck it!
